    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/papermoonio/XXX-mkdocs.git

    ```

    Directory structure should look like:

    ```markdown
    XXX-mkdocs

    ```

4. Serve the site:

    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser to view the docs. Any changes to Markdown files, snippets, or images will automatically update in the local preview.

## Repository Structure

The docs repository is organized as follows:

```markdown
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .snippets/           # Code and text snippets referenced in docs
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code/            
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ text/     
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/              # Images used in docs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <section>/           # Top-level section folder (e.g., `node-operators`)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nav.yml          # Navigation definition for this section
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md         # Section landing page
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <page>.md        # Documentation pages within this section (e.g., `run-a-node.md`)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                    
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .nav.yml             # Navigation definition for top-level sections
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md             # Main landing page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.yml        # Reusable variables used in docs
```

> üìù **Note**: Every section has an `index.md` landing page for the section and a `.nav.yml` that defines the order of the pages in this section.

## Add a New Page

1. Create a Markdown file inside the appropriate section folder. Example:

    ```markdown
    XXX-docs/node-operators/new-page.md
    ```

2. Add frontmatter and page title at the top of the file:

    ```markdown
    ---
    title: SEO-friendly page title (‚â§ 60 chars)
    description: Short page summary (120‚Äì160 chars)
    ---

    # Page heading (any length)
    ```

    - **Frontmatter title** ‚Üí SEO & search results. [Google's recommendation on good titles](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/appearance/title-link?hl=en)
    - **Description** ‚Üí meta description. [Google's recommendation on good descriptions](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/appearance/snippet?hl=en)
    - **Page heading** ‚Üí displayed at top of page

3. Write the content in Markdown. Need some help? Checkout the [Tips for Writing Content](#tips-for-writing-content) section.

    - **Images**: Place any images in the appropriate folder under `images/<section>/<page>/`. See the [images README](images/README.md) for more details.
    - **Snippets**: Add any reusable text or code example snippets to `.snippets/code/` or `.snippets/text/`. See the [snippets README](.snippets/README.md) for guidance.

4. Update the section's `.nav.yml` file to include the new page:

    ```yml
    nav:
    - 'Navigation Title': new-page.md
    ```

    - **Navigation title** ‚Üí shown in left menu; keep it short
    - **Landing page for section** ‚Üí name file `index.md`

## Tips for Writing Content

- **Start with an introduction**: Briefly explain the topic and outline what the page or guide will cover.
- **Use prerequisites when needed**: Include a `## Prerequisites` section for knowledge, tools, or accounts the reader should have before following the guide.
- **Organize content into sections**: Each section should cover a single concept or task. Use headings (##, ###) to make the structure clear.
- **Include examples and snippets**: Incorporate code examples where helpful, and include screenshots or diagrams to clarify instructions or concepts.
- **Keep guides actionable**: Use step-by-step instructions when appropriate, with concise language.
- **Provide links**: Link to other relevant documentation pages or external resources when helpful.
- **End with next steps or summary**: Let readers know what to do next (provide links), or summarize the key points.

Following these tips ensures that all documentation is clear, consistent, and easy to follow.

## Markdown and Style Guidelines

- Use heading hierarchy (#, ##, ###) logically.
- Keep sentences clear and concise.
- Use lists, tables, code blocks for clarity.
- For code blocks, always specify the language:

    ```markdown
        ```python
        print("Hello World!")
        ```
    ```

- Follow XXX terminology consistently.
- Include links to other docs or resources when relevant.
